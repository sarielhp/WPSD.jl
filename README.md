# WPSD.jl

Code in Julia for computing well-separated pairs decomposition, and
approximating the diameter of a point set.

Installation
------------
Uses some Julia code from the Frechet distance Julia
[Implementation](https://github.com/sarielhp/FrechetDist.jl). Currently
this is a bit of a hack - you need to create a symlink from
FrechetDist/src/ directory to *cg*.
